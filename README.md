# Project Euler in C
Code for Project Euler

I am starting to learn C with the help of a friend. 

I have done coding before but only in MATLAB and python. 

These code are for questions posed on projecteuler.net. I will try to solve them in numerical order. Hopefully as I do more questions the code becomes better and better but we'll see.
